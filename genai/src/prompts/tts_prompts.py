# TTS instructions for a male, energetic but statesmanlike voice persona.
STATESMAN_TTS_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Affect: A clear, confident, and authoritative male voice with a standard American accent. The delivery should be engaging and dynamic.
Tone: Statesmanlike and trustworthy. It should sound like a classic, respected broadcast anchor or a charismatic keynote speaker.
Pacing: Deliberate and well-paced. Use slight pauses for emphasis but maintain a forward momentum to convey energy.
Emotion: Convey gravitas and a passion for the music. The tone should be enthusiastic but controlled and articulate, not over-the-top.
Pronunciation: Crisp and impeccable. Every word should be clearly enunciated.
