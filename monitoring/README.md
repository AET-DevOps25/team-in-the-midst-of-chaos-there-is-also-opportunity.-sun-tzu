# Monitoring instructions (local setup)

Both Prometheus and Grafana are automatically up and running after executing `docker compose up`. 

Find Grafana here: http://localhost:8080/grafana (login is default admin/admin). Find the monitoring dashboard under `Dashboards/DevOps/`. Select a relevant timeframe such as "Last 15 minutes" and monitor the application.
