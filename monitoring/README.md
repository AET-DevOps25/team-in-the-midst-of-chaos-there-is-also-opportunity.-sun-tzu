# Monitoring instructions (local setup)

Both Prometheus and Grafana are automatically up and running after executing `docker compose up`. Find them here:

- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (login is default admin/admin). Find the monitoring dashboard under Dashboards/DevOps/. Select a relevant timeframe such as "Last 15 minutes" and monitor your application!
